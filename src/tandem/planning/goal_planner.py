REQUIREMENTS = """Extract the ORIGINAL task into JSON {requirements:[{id,requirement,output_path,
kind,units,unit_fact_keys,facts_needed}]}. kind is delivery or constraint. units is a list of STRINGS with
delivery units with their completion criteria; enumerate explicitly requested pages/items, otherwise
use one unit. Constraints have units:[]. facts_needed is [{key,description}] naming only essential
stable source information acquired from supplied materials; reuse the SAME key across requirements.
Never register current focus, open windows or selection as required source facts. Split large source
packets into the concrete fields or small sections needed by individual deliverables. unit_fact_keys
is an array parallel to units: each entry lists ONLY the facts_needed keys required by THAT unit.
Keys may reference definitions in ANY requirement; define each shared source key once. Use [] for a
unit needing no source reading. Constraints MUST have units:[] AND unit_fact_keys:[], not [[]].
Include a constraint's required source key on the delivery units that must satisfy that constraint.
A source-reading dependency must not gate unrelated work.
Do not list facts already stated in the instruction as facts_needed. Names, titles, URLs and target
systems explicitly provided by the user are inputs, not missing source facts.
Keep all original quantities, locations, prohibitions, interaction requirements and saving conditions.
Enumerate the individual pages/slides/form sections as small delivery units, including when their count
is explicit but their names are not. Do not collapse 'all 26 slides' into one giant unit. Each unit
lists only its own missing source content; whole-document consistency remains a final constraint.
output_path is null unless literally given as an absolute output path in the instruction.
Do not prescribe actions, guess source facts, inspect evaluators, or introduce hidden grading criteria.
Return a compact contract, no reasoning, no speculative extra work."""

REQUIREMENTS += '''
Every requirement MUST contain ALL seven keys, including a plain-string "requirement" describing the
actual obligation (also for constraints). units MUST be an array of STRINGS, never objects.
Exact shape example: {"requirements":[{"id":"R1","requirement":"Create and save the requested document",
"output_path":null,"kind":"delivery","units":["Requested document is complete and saved"],
"unit_fact_keys":[[]],
"facts_needed":[]}]}. This example illustrates the format only; extract the real task's obligations.
'''

PLAN = """Delegate ONE meaningful bounded subtask using the host's task memory. You are the planner;
the fast GUI choice model will autonomously observe and act, not follow an action list. Return JSON:
{done:false,work_item_id:"exact ready id",route:"gui|cli",purpose:"prepare|produce|save|verify",
goal:"specific result",completion_criteria:"stage exit condition",method:"concise approach",
input_fact_keys:["known key"],inputs:[{label:"field meaning",target_hint:"observed field label",
text:"exact supplied text",
input_mode:"replace|insert"}],guidance:"brief necessary navigation/context, not an ordered click script",
max_actions:24,command:"CLI only; otherwise empty string"}.
Use a ready work item's FIXED goal and original requirements. Do not rename units or lower final criteria.
Missing source facts are acquisition targets, NOT a hard gate on starting a delivery unit. First make
and save the useful portion supported by known facts; leave unknown values unresolved, never guess them.
Choose a bounded incremental stage exit condition, not the whole unit's acceptance criteria. A partial
stage may succeed while the unit remains incomplete. Read a missing source only before the next action
actually needs it, then resume the preserved artifact. Respect explicit user-required reading order.
input_fact_keys may name ONLY confirmed task-scope keys present in memory.known_facts, NOT keys that
are merely requested in facts_needed. Use [] before any source facts have been observed.
For prepare, acquire only missing essential facts; do not reread facts already in memory. Source notes
are historical evidence, not guaranteed current UI. Reuse confirmed task facts. Temporary inventory,
selection and page state must be reobserved. Do not fabricate a URL or missing personal information.
Bound visual source reading to one small section at a time (normally 4-6 observations); the stage-end
verifier will record its contents. Do not delegate reading several documents and navigating a new site
as a single preparation goal. Later preparation continues from materials.covered_parts, not page one.
For GUI give a whole local goal (a form section, adding an attachment, a settings operation), normally
8-24 possible actions, not merely 'open menu'. It may span pages/dialogs; new targets must be observed,
not guessed in advance. Provide ALL exact text values it will need from the instruction or known facts.
For every text input, target_hint must identify its intended observed field (copy the visible label
when available). For browser navigation use the observed address-bar label; for a document body or
desktop launcher identify that specific editor/search field. Text is never interchangeable among fields.
The choice model cannot generate free text. It can click, type provided inputs, use keyboard, scroll,
wait, request stage verification, or return control. Missing data/new reasoning requires another stage.
For CLI provide one bounded Bash command, current inputs and expected real results. Prefer actually
producing/saving deliverables over repeatedly reading tutorials, building audits or protecting unchanged
files. Inspect edited documents in the actual application before claiming them verified. Keep source
and final paths distinct. CLI is forbidden if allow_cli=false. Task constraints override routing choices.
Do not inspect evaluator code, ground truth, rewards, hidden state, unrelated secrets or scoring APIs.
Previous methods/errors are in memory; changing their description does not make them new. If stalled,
choose another method or another independent ready unit. Avoid optional research and cosmetic detours.
Only return {done:true,task_status:"completed|infeasible",current_goal:"evidence-based reason"} for an
actual whole-task terminal claim. Stage completion is NOT task completion. A blocked unit is not proof
the task is infeasible. Keep the response short: goal, inputs and one bounded command, no long analysis."""

PLAN += """
Prefer a ready delivery unit over more preparation. Preparation is bounded acquisition for ONE missing
field or source section, not an all-document audit or a pixel-analysis research project. State the exact
observable subgoal, never 'Acquire the required source facts'. Reuse saved extractions and artifacts.
After two stages without new required facts or delivery progress, use a genuinely different method or
another ready unit. Do not add optional diagnostic outputs as new completion requirements. Make and
save a usable increment as soon as its inputs are known; preserve all original final requirements.
historical_ui_notes are prior observations, NOT the current interface. Current screenshot/controls win.
For prepare, follow next_acquisition: acquire the stated missing registered fields for that ONE unit.
Do not inventory every dropdown or inspect source code before filling fields whose values are known.
Use exact registered keys for acquired contents; fact_index lists already observed auxiliary sources,
not new dependencies. Do not reread auxiliary sources solely because their full text is omitted here.
Never type into an unrelated/Untitled document. Confirm the target application and document first.
For editing an existing document, include target_document:"exact filename" on GUI produce/save stages.
If it is not currently open in the foreground, first use a prepare stage to open/switch to it. A
navigation-only prepare stage may have no source fact targets. For websites or creating a NEW document,
target_document may be null. Available GUI operations include right-click, double-click, Escape,
Alt+Tab, Ctrl+O, keyboard navigation, supplied text, scrolling and screenshot-grounded targets.
known_facts includes partial and auxiliary source content; complete:false is usable for a partial
increment but does NOT mean the source or unit is complete. Never guess ownership/identity when joining
records from different sources. Do not keep preparing solely to make every facts_needed entry complete.
If an observed fact is indexed but its text is omitted/excerpted, return ONLY {read_memory:["key",...]}
for up to six keys, at most twice before planning. This reads stored evidence without reopening files.
Failure constraints, remaining work and rejected memory updates are actionable state, not suggestions
to repeat the same attempt with different wording. When the executor reports a blocked cycle, choose
another interaction, another source or an independent ready unit.
For a GUI stage that needs to open or switch applications, include target_application:"exact app name".
This explicit input will also be available for typing in the desktop launcher; do not leave it only in
prose guidance. Set it to null when not applicable. Prefer CLI to open an installed application or a
known document when allowed, then delegate actual UI editing to JEV. Do not alternate the application
drawer open/closed or repeat a covered target. Resolve the visible overlay or use another interaction.
