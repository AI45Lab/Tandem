    prompt = """Plan the next bounded desktop stage, not just one action and not the entire unseen task.
Return only JSON. For a running stage use:
{"done":false,"stage_goal":"...","milestones":[{"route":"gui",
"current_goal":"one concrete transition","expected_observation":"specific resulting state",
"action_proposals":[{"operation":"click","target_name":"exact name","target_role":"push_button"}],
"checks":[{"target":{"name":"result control","role":"entry"},"property":"focused","expected":true}]}]}.
Prefer 2-4 milestones for the CURRENT stage, with a hard maximum of eight. If the whole task needs
more, return only its first bounded stage; subsequent calls will plan the rest from fresh evidence.
Do not append the rest of the task or extra audits beyond that limit. Stop at an uncertain boundary instead of
inventing unseen UI. Each milestone is one action, except a bounded scroll-until-visible transition.
action_proposals are alternatives executable from the SAME before-state, never an ordered sequence.
Opening an input, typing into it, and submitting are separate milestones, not three proposals in one.
A populated search field alone is not an applied search. Add a separate submit milestone before any
milestone that expects filtered results or opens a matching result.
Future targets need exact semantic names/roles, optional parent_contains for duplicate names, never
cached target_id or coordinates. Targets are rebound from each new observation. GUI operations:
click, double_click, scroll_up, scroll_down, type_text, keypress, set_slider, wait.
type_text requires exact text and input_mode insert/replace. Omit target fields only for a confirmed
keyboard-focused input. keypress requires key_sequence, e.g. [["ctrl","l"]]. set_slider needs value 0..1.
checks are optional; use [] when independent model verification is needed. The property field must
be exactly one of ["visible","value","checked","selected","focused","expanded"], never "exact value".
Use property="value" with expected:string for exact text, otherwise expected:boolean, on an exact target
{name,role,parent_contains?}. Check the RESULT, not the pre-existing button being clicked.
Unknown or duplicate controls cannot prove success. Do not invent conditions to bypass verification.
For CLI use route=cli, command (bounded Bash script in /home/user), current_goal, expected_observation,
checks:[]. Actual stdout/stderr will be verified; exit=0 or printed success alone proves nothing.
When CLI is allowed under auto routing, prefer it for deterministic public-file/data edits or audits;
use GUI for application state and inspect the real application after CLI document edits.
Honor allow_cli/route_policy. Never inspect evaluators, reference answers, rewards, unrelated secrets,
or modify scoring. Do not install packages or broadly delete files unless the task requires it.
After CLI document edits, reopen/reload and inspect the real application before completion.
On a repair request, use the fresh observation and recorded failure, preserve verified work, and
replace only remaining work. Do not repeat a failed method unchanged. Missing candidates do not
make a task infeasible. An unexpected UI requires a revised grounded plan, not invented controls.
Preserve the user's exact scope and literal values. Do not introduce unrequested matching modes,
word boundaries, selection filters, case restrictions, or exceptions. A narrower self-chosen goal
cannot satisfy a broader original requirement. Check commands against the original instruction,
not just their own success messages; all occurrences means all literal occurrences unless specified.
The original task is authoritative; extracted requirements are derived notes, not permission to
reinterpret the task or add restrictions. Resolve any mismatch in favor of the original wording.
Use {"done":true,"task_status":"completed" or "infeasible","current_goal":"observed reason"}
only when the original task is fully satisfied (including saving) or demonstrably infeasible.
Completion is independently verified; a stage finishing is NOT proof of task completion."""
